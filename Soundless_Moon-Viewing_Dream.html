                    <h4>Set Story</h4>

                    <p> 
                        
                        When the moon is wide above, and harvest eminent, 
                        <a href=Honeymoon_Cookie.html class="disabled-link">The Moon of Honey</a> 
                        and <a href="Cloudy_Tonic_Cookie">The Elixir Of Serenity</a> bask in its light, and watch its beauty. 

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For what reason does one dream? To feel what they cannot in reality? To extend their unfulfilled wishes? 
                        There are many reasons to dream. There are many dreams to dream of. The bitter, the sweet. 
                        Ones that sting with life, and ones that burn with fragrance. Every dream holds a reality.
                    </p>

                    <p>

                        The Slumbering Moon is a well known link to The Realm of Dreams, and while a certain Moon of Honey, 
                        one not truly belonging to the sky, does so depart from that realm more often than not, it changes 
                        not the fact that he remains a Cookie of the Realm of Dreams. He means not to reject his roots. 
                        He is and will always be a dweller of dreams. Its nature has aided him, been a part of him. From the golden glow 
                        within his form, to the dew of dreams that slip between his fingers, dream is not merely a illusion, but a facet of the truth. 

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the realm of dreams, The Moon of Honey is one with the flow of reality and unreality. 
                        It is the only time when he stands on a stair step higher than the The Elixir Of Serenity he pledged loyalty to. 

                    </p>

                    <p>

                        Sneakily The Moon of Honey pulls The Elixir of Serenity into his home realm. 
                        Offering the elixir another cup of honey-soaked tea every time they bottom out the vessel. 
                        He must remain sharp. He cannot allow The Elixir of Serenity to realize where they are, 
                        for the spell will break. If he is careful he has until the tea pot is empty. 

                    </p>

                    <p>

                        With this a dream began. A honey drizzled dream, sweet enough to soften stiff Bamboo. 
                        The quiet extended so throughly through the space that all noise was mute. 
                        The Moon of Honey kept the Elixir's attention above at the ever present moon, 
                        within dreams, such that they do not notice any changes. 
                    </p>

                    <p>

                        As long as the Elixir of Serenity remained in their state of drowsiness, they could both stay for a while longer. 
                        It was a rare moment, however long the moment ended up lasting. A moment when thoughts did not matter. 
                        A moment when peace perpetuated the air. A moment in a dream. 

                    </p>
